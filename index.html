        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Restaurant Manager ðŸ¥˜</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Natnary specializes in cooking, with most experience in European, Asian, and American foods. She also manages her employees and head kitchen, frequently checking and instructing them on the quality of the food, as well as taste, presentation, and efficiency, while keeping the experience of the customer to be over-satisfactory. Natnary is diligent, hardworking, and she is able to adapt perfectly to sudden changes and mishaps in the kitchen. This allows the kitchen to run more smoothly and keep the customers satisfied.Not only has she been a restaurant manager over the past five years, but she has been familiar with the restaurant industry since she was young. Her family owns three restaurants, and she has worked at all restaurants. From the little girl who handed out menus, to wiping, sweeping, and mopping the floors and tables, to working as the cashier, to making the food in the kitchen, Natnary has been through it all. Sheâ€™s trained in most, if not all, of the foundational joints in the kitchen, and sheâ€™s worked her way up to the top. Sheâ€™s helped her family businesses save money by paying attention to the demands of popular dishes the customers want, encouraging her ingredient supplier to limit the surplus of unused ingredients. Sheâ€™s increased visibility by marketing the restaurants on social media platforms, adding a younger age group to the restaurant rather than keeping it at a family level restaurant. To add on, her restaurants are filled with customers who have been visiting for over ten years because the friendliness of her family remains the same, and sheâ€™s been able to build and maintain the customer relationships over time through the quality of the food and the service. 
<br><br>

        On another note, Natnaryâ€™s hobbies include dancing, cooking, of course, and vlogging. She has been dancing consistently for around seven years, but she started her dance career, like most people, with ballet in kindergarten. Sheâ€™s been on competitive dance teams for all seven years, including Q-Minor and Zero Below. Natnary has also been involved in an international community exhibition team, FutureShockLA, which is a part of the CultureShockLA junior family team. They specialize in community outreach, helping out with community service projects such as beach clean-ups and H4, which is a hip-hop educational program for kids. Moving on, she has been cooking since she was little, originally taught Thai dishes by her parents. She then wanted to branch out and learn other cultural dishes and taught herself how to make them by watching YouTube videos. Finally, she recently found enjoyment in vlogging. Only starting out vlogs for fun on Snapchat, she realized she can edit and make her videos more exciting through her own iPhone with iMovie, posting edited vlogs for her friends. 
<br><br>

        Natnary always pursues to motivate and inspire her team, and she emphasizes the importance of collaboration and communication. Through this, the wellbeing of her employees and her customers prove extraordinary, and she has the dedication and hard work to maintain and strive for more.
